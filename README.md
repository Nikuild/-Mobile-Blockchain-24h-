## 🚀 The "Why The Fuck" Project

I wanted to prove that in 2025, you don't need:
- 💻 A computer ❌
- 👨‍💻 A team ❌  
- 📅 Months of work ❌
- 🧠 Sanity ❌

**Just a phone, AI, and 24 hours of pure chaos.**

## 📊 Real Performance (No Bullshit)


## 🛠️ Tech Stack (The Madness)

| What | Why |
|------|-----|
| 📱 **Smartphone** | Because laptops are for losers |
| 🤖 **AI Assistant** | My rubber duck with PhD |
| ⚡ **JavaScript** | Enterprise-grade, obviously |
| 💾 **In-memory DB** | Persistence is overrated |
| ☕ **Node.js** | Because why not? |

## 🎯 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone this madness
git clone https://github.com/Nikuild/-Mobile-Blockchain-24h-.git

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Run the chaos
node mobile-blockchain.js

# 4. Question your life choices
